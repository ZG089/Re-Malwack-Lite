> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## Requirements

> - Requires internet connection in order to download hosts file during installation, otherwise it will use the bundled hosts file.

## Download Module
> [!TIP]
> You can download the module from [Releases](https://github.com/ZG089/Re-Malwack/releases/latest) section.


## Get started
> [!NOTE]
> 1. Open Magisk, go to Modules section, click on the '+' icon, then select the Re-Malwack Lite Module zip file to install.
> 2. Reboot your device to activate the Re-Malwack Lite Module's protective features.
> 3. Enjoy, Your device is fully protected now :)

## Command Usage (How to use Re-Malwack Lite on Terminal)

Type``su -c rmlwk-lite`` on Termux to show up the help message which will output this:

```
"Usage: rmlwk-lite [ --reset | --blockporn | --block-gambling | --block-fake |  --update-hosts | --blacklist <domain> | --whitelist <domain> | --help | -h ]"
"--update-hosts: Updates the hosts file"
"--reset: Restore the hosts file to its original state. (Disable ads blocking)"
"--blockporn: Block pornographic websites by adding entries to the hosts file."
"--block-gambling: Block gambling sites"
"--block-fake: Block Fake news sites"
"--whitelist <domain>: Remove the specified domain from the hosts file."
"--blacklist <domain>: Adds domain to the hosts file to be blocked
"--help: Display this help message."
"-h: same as --help
```

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use this module with any other ad blocker module, such as AdAway and Magisk's built-in systemless hosts module. They may get angry if they met each other, and may cause a war that will benefit no one.

> [!NOTE]
> - For KernelSU users and for those who noticed that the hosts file isn't updated after running ``su -c rmlwck-lite --update-hosts``, install [Overlayfs](https://github.com/HuskyDG/magic_overlayfs) module, configure it and it will work. (if you need help configuring it then contact with me via Telegram or XDA)

> [!TIP]
> ## Total Blocked
> - 907,120+ Malware, Ads, Spyware

## How does it work?
> [!TIP]
> **Where is the file?**
> - Your ``hosts`` file located in ``/system/etc``. It "acts" like your school blocking service that blocks you from going to websites. However, this (the ``Hosts`` file) is done locally on your phone's root system. 

> [!TIP]
> **How does the host's file block websites and what modifications were made?**
> - How does it block websites: The host file blocks websites and malware by denying access for your phone to connect to it at all. It will just return a blank page. ``0.0.0.0 www.the-website-that-is-blocked.com``.

> [!TIP]
> **Does it blocks in-app ads and in-game ads as well ?**
> - Of course it does ! All of this using the magic of magisk and the hosts file !
